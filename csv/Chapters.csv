"Hossegor, South of France",https://www.spiritsurfschool.com/upload-cms/image-galerie3.jpg,Source: Spirit surf school,https://www.spiritsurfschool.com/upload-cms/image-galerie3.jpg,"First I want to talk about the Southern French coast which includes some of the most famous locations for surfers such as La Graviere and La Centrale, both located in Hossegor. These two locations have been past hosts for the professional surfing tour which used to stop here every year.<br><br>The food here is great and the crowds are not too bad since the beaches here spread for many kilometers and there is plenty of space for everyone.

It has some of the best views along the coast with long steps that take you down to the beach.,14,3,orange,Cote de Basques,43.48104503,-1.566323446,,,,

",After this you will be making your way into Northern Spain. On the way there I recommend passing by a couple different beaches. Lafitenia is one of them which offers a beautiful right hand point break and has some small restaurants right on the beach in case you get hungry.,16,4,orange,lafitenia,43.4146436,-1.628951957,,,,

After surfing, I recommend going into the city for lunch where you will enjoy some of the best food that you will find on your trip. My favorite spot there is Bar Zabaleta where they have the best Spanish tortilla, it is truly amazing.

Zarautz,https://ciudadsurf.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/surf-en-zarautz-1.jpg,Source: city of zarautz,https://ciudadsurf.com/surf-en-zarautz/,"Another mythical surf spot on this coast that you can pass by before crossing into Portugal is Zarautz which is arguably the most famous beachbreak in the basque country. It has been home for many surf contests and many surf legends like Sunny Garcia and 11 time world champion Kelly Slater.

"Nazare, Portugal",https://d14fqx6aetz9ka.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/02091816/HelioAntonioNov2018.jpeg,Source: Surfline,https://www.surfline.com/surf-news/15-craziest-nazare-moments-time/95441,Portugal is one of the places in the world with the largest surf community. Most surfers over there are pretty friendly but you will want to beware of the locals and be respectful when you enter the water to get a surf in. The first spot that you will want to pass by is Nazare. Nazare is one of the most famous spots in the world where some of the largest waves in history have been recorded. In the summer the waves should be pretty fun but if you are going in winter you will want to be careful and make sure to only go out if you are an experienced surfer. ,17,7,orange,"Nazare, Portugal",39.61469874,-9.085376519,,,,

Supertubos is one of the most famous beach breaks in Europe famous for its great barrels, hence the name which basically means huge barrels. The waves here can also not be user friendly on the big days so you might want to catch it on a smaller day or look for another break nearby.

"Safi, Morocco",https://www.youtube.com/embed/xFP4ZwHqXKo,Source: Surfforecast.com,https://www.surf-forecast.com/breaks/Safi-Garden/photos/6730,After making your way into Morocco either by plane or by ferry you can make your way down to Safi. Safi is a pretty small town with not much around but the scenery and the waves are great. The food is also something to experience and I definitely recommend stopping by here before getting to the final magic spot.,17,9,orange,Safi,32.33202615,-9.279608726,,,,

It is a right hand point break that stretched for kilometers. If you get the right wave, you can probably get the longest wave of your life there.
